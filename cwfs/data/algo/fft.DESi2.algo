This file contains the parameters used to define the Poisson Solver properties
PoissonSolever: "fft" = Fast Fourier Transform method per Roddier & Roddier 1993, "exp" = Series expansion method per Guruyev & Nugent 1996
Num_of_Zernike: Total number of zernike coefficients fitted to the estimated wavefront map
Num_of_outer_itr: Total number of times the outer compensation loop is iterated over
Num_of_inner_itr: Total number of times the inner FFT based solver iterates for each out loop iteration 
Zernikes:  0 = standard filled, 1 = annular as defined by system, 0 > x > 1 = use as obscuration ratio
Increase_resolution: Pixel resolution multiplier - must be integer - used for internal computations
FFT_dimension: 999 = automatically chooses next 2^n integer > than smallest image dimension, else specify 2^n integer > than smallest image dimension
Feedback_gain: Fraction of inner loop solution that is added to the accumulated solution for compensation 
Compensator_mode: zer = derivatives and Jacobians calculated from Zernike polynomials, opd = derivitives and Jacobians calculated from wavefront map
Compensator_oversample: Internal resolution multiplier for the compensator - must be integer
OffAxis_poly_order: order of polynomial used for off-axis distortion corection - 8 or 10 allowed
Boundary_thickness: defines how far the computation mask extends beyond the pupil mask
		and, in fft.algo, it is also the width of Neuman boundary where the derivative of the wavefront is set to zero 
Compensation_sequence: File name where the comensation sequence is defined - sets compensated zernike order vs iteration
Sumclip_sequence: File name where the signal clipping sequence is defined
